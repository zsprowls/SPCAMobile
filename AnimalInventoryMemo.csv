Everyone tells me I’m handsome and regal, but what I really want you to know is that I’m smart as a whip and love to train. Learning new things is my favorite, and you can practically see my wheels turning as I figure things out. I’m still young, so sometimes my “puppy brain” gets in the way, but with structure I catch on fast. I’ll be honest — I’m not the easiest guy to get to know. Meeting new people can be hard for me, and I need a little time and routine to feel comfortable. But once I trust you? I’m playful, goofy, and super cuddly. I really do want to please the people I love. I’m looking for someone patient and experienced who’s ready for a fun, energetic, and very smart project dog. If you give me consistency and guidance, I promise I’ll give you loyalty, laughs, and a whole lot of love. Could I be your once-in-a-lifetime best friend? Want to find out more about me or meet me in person ? ****Call the SPCA Behavior Team at 716-875-7360 x 268 and they will set up a meet and greet for us !",Dog Adoptions A,43,Dog Adoptions A,7,1246,406

She explored the room and then was seeking my attention and loved to be pet. She sometimes did put her whole mouth on me to solicit more petting, but very gentle mouth - mostly just slobber.

She did not have much interest in toys but she was a lot more engaged during the walk. 11/14/2023 Sr 11:00AM Noble did well on her walk. She appears to be positively interested in other dogs and I believe I will coordinate a meet and greet with fellow staff members. As this will make her more marketable for adopters. 11/15/2023 SR 12:48PM Noble was good on her walk and walked well. Nothing notable. 11/17/23 ND I took Noble for a walk this morning. offered treats in the kennel which she did take before I leash her. No issues putting the leash on. She was really great outside, she is very fun and bouncy. She was very interested in exploring the environment. No issues fitting her for a collar or bringing her back to the kennel. Really great gal!! 11/20/2023 SR I had Noble out for a walk and some enrichment. She walked well on leash and was very excitable jumping up on my every so-often to solicit attention. When brought back to the behavior office she was mildly mischievous but overall well-behaved. Obsessed with food as expected. 11/21/2023 SR ~ 30 minutes Upon approach at her kennel she was giving me soft eyes, demand barks and some wide wags. She readily went up to the kennel and jumped up when she saw me. She was very high-energy when I entered her kennel but allowed me to leash without issue. She used the restroom outside and pulled intermittently but otherwise good walker. I gave a bath and washed her twice but she still is pretty odorous. Behaved ok but still not a fan of the bath. 11/22/2023 SR ~ 15 minutes I took Noble out for a walk after sometime surgery. Nothing notable as she was a shell of her former self after surgery. Used the restroom outside without issue. 11/27/2023 SR ~ 25 MINUTES I took Noble out for some enrichment and a walk. She walked well and was well-behaved for most of the walk. Very playful when brought into the enrichment room and let go of toys when asked. Before the walk, she had a meet and greet with Miley (A0054811914). When approached at the fence she displayed some stiff body but offered appropriate sniffs. When Miley entered the same yard she was very vocal and whining while pulling to get to her. When they were able to meet face to face she was interested and mostly appropriate but very high-energy. She appeared to be too much for Miley and Miley offered some low-growls when Noble placed her head on top of hers before jumping towards her. 11/28/2023 SR ~ 30 minutes Brought Noble back in from kennel and brought her to Education center (left side) for some playtime. She was very well-behaved and we worked more with impulse control. She appears to be already well-trained but still very forward when it comes to meeting new people or going through doors. Easy fix by working on wait and until she is give a command like ""go ahead"" or similar when the appropriate behavior is displayed. We played fetch approximately 8 times engaged in a chase game a couple times before ending session. 11/29-30/2023 SR ~ 45 -1 hour each I took Noble for a walk and fitted her for a new harness and leash. Walked well with new harness and stayed at an appropriate distance from me when walking. She was very agile and treat-motivated during her play session. Responded appropriately the chase game and responding to commands. Better with waiting for toys but still needs more work. She is really good with jumping as high as she can for her toys. In addition, I brought her in to meet my ARK group and she was very appropriate and borderline gentle when it comes to taking toys and. She was more on the rough side when it comes to taking treats. 12/02/2023 SR I had Noble out for a walk and some enrichment time in the room. She was great as usual. No issues. 12/11/2023 SR I had Noble out for a walk and some playtime in the ed center. Great and very responsive to commands. 12/12-13/2023 SR 3:30PM She did well in her play session as usual.

I love being social with people and other dogs, though I’ll admit I can be a little aloof sometimes—it’s just my way of keeping things cool and calm. Most of the time, I’ve got an easygoing vibe. I enjoy hanging out, exploring new places, and taking in all the sights and smells. I’m also pretty curious, so adventures with me are never boring! I do like snacks and treats (who doesn’t?), and I’ll happily work for them, but food isn’t the only thing that makes me happy—I really just enjoy good company. If you’re looking for a friendly, steady dog who’s equal parts fun and chill, I think we’d be a great match. I can’t wait to meet my person and start our new life together!

He was very outgoing - jumped up onto the kennel door with loose body language and ""wiggle butt"". He allowed me to place a slip lead over his head easily and walked well out of the holding kennels. Due to the information given to us by the adopter, I opted to take Snoopy to the squeeze cage for his vaccination. He walked well on the leash and once we entered the room, he got right into the squeeze cage without being prompted. On visual exam, his BCS seems to have decreased and there was discoloration on his tail. Since he was doing well with Lana and I, we took him to the tech office for a reweigh and exam. In the tech office, Snoopy took treats very gently from my hand and was easy to lead onto the scale. When Lana went to touch his tail, he tucked his butt in and turned around. He did not snap at her or growl, just licked her hand in appeasement, but was clearly uncomfortable with his hind end being touched. There were no injuries or open wounds evident to us on his tail. He was easy to walk back into the kennel and he let me lean over and take the slip lead off his neck while I fed him more treats. I will be keeping him Hold-doc as he did lose a significant amount of weight, but behaviorally he did very well today! :) 9/6/25 ND Did well for harnessing. Did well on walk. no issues was very prosocial with me. a few animal care staff were sitting outside on the curb by the back garage. snoopy started growling but was easily redirected. once he heard their voices he became loose and wiggly. no issues going back inside. moved to a bigger kennel.",Dog Adoptions C,52,Dog Adoptions C,8,1246,406

Whenever anyone would walk into the room he would bark excessively and jump off the walls and at one point began climbing up the door. Both PP and I ignored him and tried to minimize foot traffic into the room. We did enter to try and administer meds to the dog next to Brody. I was sat on the ground with my outer left thigh pressed against Brody's door. While working with the other dog, Brody barked repeatedly at me and when he didn't get attention he proceeded to grab my scrubs and pull several times, tearing the pants of my scrubs. He bit and released three times, but did not grab any skin. I then put the dog we were working with back in the kennel and moved away from the door. When I moved, Brody bared teeth while in a play bow and tried to grab my pants one more time. He had loose, wiggly body language during the whole interaction - suspect he was trying to get attention/was frustrated at lack of attention and not trying to be malicious. Notified Natalia of this interaction just to make behavior aware. 7/31/25 ND/MN MN and I spent some time with Brody due to memo above. He was jumpy for harnessing but was easily managed with asking him for a sit and luring with treats, he will jump and muzzle punch. He walked well and used the restroom outside. He seems to get frustrated when little direction is given to him and he jumps/tris to muzzle punch, did knock MN' glasses off. He is easily redirected with basic commands (sit). He can get mouthy when overwhelmed or frustrated. We took him to the front play yard. He again needed a lot of direction and was constantly looking for us for something to do. When that wasn't given he was jumpy and would nip/mouth. He was easily redirected. Did very well with learning ""touch"" and ""down"" commands. MN and I opted to leave him off of the adoption floor as we feel he needs a little more work on these behaviors/needs more of a routine. We will continue to work on his manners before adoption and consult adopters on his training needs. 8/2/25 Maddyn took for walk today and was okay, had a hard time harnessing was very jumpy,mouthy and unruly. went to play yard and he did great, did some training and he was listening well being procial to me and KateW (bless her for coming w/) when we left the play yard and were in between the closed gates he started to jump and mouth me non stop nipping me hard, he grab my boob, my leg, back, butt, treat bag, citronella spray and broke it, just continuously jumping and lunging towards me after Kate Webster took control of him still was locking eyes on me, was able to get back into kennel with KateW walking and putting inside no issues. as i was writing this AC team came in to let me know he grabbed one of them today in attempt to mount and would not let go, was mouthy and throwing all his weight onto them. took him off housebroken board , will re eval and discuss further monday 8/4-5/25 ND Brody did well both days. Decided to take him on walks both days. Was able to keep his threshold down buy luring with treats while harnessing. working on him sitting at every door way.

I’m Brody – your future best friend, adventure buddy, and personal clown all rolled into one very wiggly package. I’m a confident guy who’s always ready to explore new places, meet new people, and make the most out of life. I’ve got energy, charm, and plenty of tricks up my sleeve (well… up my paws). I’m super food motivated and toy obsessed, so training with me is both fun and rewarding – I already know how to belly crawl, roll over, and even play dead! My excitement sometimes makes me a little bouncy (okay, very bouncy), but it’s just because I’m so happy to see you. When I’m not showing off my moves, you’ll probably find me rolling around in the grass with the world’s biggest grin, or trotting happily on a walk while I take in all the smells.

She was prosocial as I approached her kennel she was very loose and wiggly front paws on the bars of her kennel. (approached from the back as animal care was cleaning). I tossed her some treats. When I opened the door and attempted to leash her with a slip leash she flinched and backed up. Once I pulled leash away she was loose and wiggly again. Ended up having to lure her through the leash with treats. She pulled on the leash. Did flinch of fast hand movements over her head. She was very focused on sniffing outside. Did use the bathroom. Did take treats and check in with me on our short walk. no issues getting back in her kennel. added to HB board,Dog Holding F,28,Dog Holding F,8,1246,406

She has two kittens fostering for socialization. I called and she said Bingo hisses when she tries to pet her and ""freaked out"" when she was holding her to introduce her to a friend. I explained the importance of positive reinforcement, going at the animal's pace, and not forcing them into scary or uncomfortable situations. It seems like she and Bingo have a good relationship, but she's worried about her doing well with new people. I told her to, for now, start at square one for new people, don't force interactions, and use positive reinforcement to build positive associations with new people. - GE 9/24/25",Foster Home,257,Foster Home,144,1246,406

Per Dr. Kean, prognosis is guarded, waiting on results of stone, but that she may still be adoption candidate. Vet staff states that Blue is behaviorally difficult to work with. ALD called and spoke with Prev O about situation, asking Prev O if there is anything we can do to support her keeping Blue. O states that her QOL is declining and that she cannot give blue the care she needs. ALD and Prev O discussed the possibility that Blue could be PTS pending test results and behavior assessment and O was understanding of the situation.

Mary also shared that she lets ""Wesley"" outside when she is having coffee and myself and KM spoke with her about the importance of keeping ""Wesley"" inside as he is still under SPCA medical care. Flea medication was also applied to ""Wesley"" by Paige (vet tech) as animal was due. Appointment care also given to Mary to keep in her wallet and on her refrigerator reminding her when ""Wesley's"" dental appointment was as she repeatedly would state it is in October.

I’m house trained , crate trained, quiet, and well-behaved in the home. I know all sorts of cool tricks like sit, down, stay, wait, spin, and leave it. I adore car rides, beach days, and short walks — but most of all, I love being close to my people. If you’ve got a lap or a free hand for pets, I’m there! I live with other dogs in my foster home and get along well, especially with ones who match my energy. I’d do great in a quiet, adult home with someone who’s patient and willing to continue helping me grow. I just need a little time to warm up — and once I do, I’ll be your most loyal shadow.

When we arrived, the family was already in the park sitting under a pavilion. As we approached, their dog, Angie immediately ran to the end of the leash and started barking at Beaker. I put Beaker into a sit stay and asked the owners if this was a typical reaction from Angie. They stated they weren't sure because she does not interact with many other dogs. Beaker greeted Clare, who had not met previously and was appropriate, leaning into brief pets but did seem more interested in meeting their dog. We started parallel walking, with Beaker more in the lead, which allowed Angie to sniff his genital area. After this she seemed a little more at ease. Beaker was social and energetic but did seem to be overwhelming to Angie when he would try to sniff her too much, or bounce around, bumping into her to initiate play. He attempted to jump on her a few times, but was pulled back before he could proceed. We continued for a few minutes parallel walking with brief interactions on our way down to the creek. Once we reached the creek, Beaker was more interested in rolling and swimming in the water, which gave me more time to speak with Tiffany about Angie. Angie had only ever lived with another dog when she was very young, and does not have any dog friends that she plays with. During our time at the creek, Angie seemed more friendly with Beaker, but would loudly correct Beaker if he got too close to her. Beaker was very respectful to the corrections and would immediately back off, but continued to try to play with Angie after a few seconds. We made our way back up to the pavilion to find some shade since Angie appeared to be exhausted after our brief excursion. Once at the pavilion, Angie seems to quickly lose tolerance of Beaker and continued to snap at him if he got too close to her. At one point, she got stiff and over top of Beaker when he was laying in the grass, I quickly removed Beaker from her reach. Beaker walked over to the water cup Angie had previously been drinking from, and Angie tried to rush back over to the water in a manner that appeared to be guarding. Beaker was then rolling in the grass and Angie began barking at him with raised hackles while straining to the end of the owners leash. Beaker did not react back to any of these circumstances, and was put into a down stay at my side for the next few minutes. The owners of Angie seemed unsure of what behaviors were playful, and what behaviors were concerning. I expressed my concerns with Angie seeming overwhelmed with Beaker. Tiffany then relayed that Angie had been diagnosed with Cushing the day before. They were currently waiting to hear back from their vet with a treatment plan for her. I told Tiffany and Clare that Beaker might be too much for Angie given the age difference, energy difference, and Angies current medical condition. We discussed the possibility of giving the dogs their own space in the home if Beaker was too much and Tiffany seemed to be on board. I expressed that both owners seemed wonderful and that I would love for them to adopt Beaker, but I needed to discuss the dog interaction with the behavior department before proceeding. Tiffany stated she was already in love with Beaker but agreed that he might be too much for Angie. She asked if we could do more meet and greets, maybe in a temperature controlled environment. I told her I would check with Natalia to see if this is an option. We ended the meet and greet with a plan to touch base the following day. I called Natalia on my way home and relayed all the above information. Natalia will follow up with Tiffany on Wednesday. LK",If The Fur Fits,267,If The Fur Fits,36,1246,406

He came in bouncy, loose, open mouth, exuberant and went up to each one of us to say hello, accept petting and was very prosocial the entire time. We spent quite a bit of time with him - he accepted petting, played fetch, performed sit, down, touch and accepted handling easily. He let me handle him everywhere and only got a little overstimulated when the play ramped up to tugging where he began to mouth but was quickly redirected to a toy. He showed no signs of being uncomfortable and any mouthiness was typical and mild for his age. Lyndsey stated that he is only uncomfortable at this point over a baby gate or exercise pen behind her desk at work, and this behavior has not translated to a fenced in area. A plus is also that when he is uncomfortable he will back up and bark, so there is a way to predict the situation and avoid it as well as a warning before any escalation in behavior. My recommendation is that we put him up for adoption from the foster home and advise potential adopters of areas that he can be uncomfortable and how to handle and prevent it.",If The Fur Fits,267,If The Fur Fits,36,1246,406

Being with each other gives us comfort and confidence, so we’re looking for a home that can welcome both of us . We’re super smart — we already know sit, stay, and down, and we’re always up for learning more (especially if treats are involved). We love going for walks, splashing in the water, meeting new people, and soaking up all the love and attention we can get. We’re affectionate, social, and very in tune with our people. Because of our size and strength, we’re hoping to find a home with experience with large dogs — someone who understands the joys and responsibilities of having two big cuddle bugs around. If you’ve got room in your heart (and on your couch!) for two loyal, loving companions, we promise we’ll fill your life with double the love, double the loyalty, and double the tail wags.",If The Fur Fits,267,If The Fur Fits,36,1246,406

At this age, I’ve got the whole “calm and cool” thing down. I’m the kind of dog who likes to find a cozy spot, lay down, and quietly take in everything happening around me. I’m a great listener, an even better companion, and I’ll always be nearby, just enjoying your company. I’m sweet and social — I like meeting new people and other friendly pets too. I’m not the wild toy-chasing type, but I do have a soft spot for a good squeaky toy every now and then. If you’re looking for a mellow best friend who will always have your back and fill your home with love and quiet joy, I might be your guy. Let’s take life slow and sweet — together.

The SPCA assumed that the owner got someone to take the cat. No one was in communication with each other. On Monday 9/8 the owner of the property arrived with Joe Miranda to find the cat in the locked apartment sitting in the window. Upon entering the apartment the cat appeared extremely skinny and thirsty. Taco meat and a bowl of water were offered to the cat who devoured both immediately. the SPCA was contacted and Joe offered to bring the cat to the shelter. Agents were dispatched to the location but then would not take the cat from Joe since he had no eviction paperwork. Joe was then directed to get the cat and bring it to the SPCA. Upon arrival at the shelter the cat was booked in under the person who left it behind and not Joe Miranda. I spoke to TMC and she was going to change it but that hasn't been done yet.

Spoke with ALD and dog was booked in medical field surrender as LW gave me an SPCA road surrender form and when I booked the dog in I booked the dog in under the owner's name and used her phone number as her signature. ALD is aware and will notify BW dog is on the way. Per ALD the owner was quoted a crazy amount from GA E Clinic and owner wants dog back. Since owner was not here at time of surrender SPCA will have to notify owner to apply for CC or put through Vet Billing if possible. SMV,Large Dog Recovery,7,Large Dog Recovery,2,1246,406

Owner was suppossed to come in 9/26 and no showed and then no showed 9/29/2025. Owner came in this morning and when I told owner it was going to be $900.00 she said she spoke with BW and BW told her she could pay $50.00 deposit and then when the court settlement came through from the person that hit the dog she would sign the check over to SPCA to pay the $850.00 balance??? I ran this by BW who said she never told her that. After back and forth SPCA will put Chapo into SPCA foster care as the dog will need several bandage changes and the owner does not qualify for Care Credit. I explained to the owner that we will put the dog in foster which means he will remain the SPCA's property until medically cleared and then BEFORE we return the dog legally to her we will process the $900.00 plus $25.00 fee through Vet Billing IF she has not received money from the settlement....BW is good with this arrangement. I also discussed this with Chief Wood as I wanted an Officer to reiterate that the dog is SPCA property until medically cleared and that the owner MUST show up for all medical follow up appointments! Per RR per Dr. Kean bandage will be changed this afternoon and owner can come in at 3:00pm to pick up dog. I did update all the owner information and will notify Foster Care that she will be here at 3:00pm. SMV",Large Dog Recovery,7,Large Dog Recovery,2,1246,406

I may be small, but I’ve got big fish energy. My hobbies include dramatic swishy entrances, staring intensely like I’m plotting something (I’m not… probably), and pretending I’ve never eaten before every single time you walk by. I’m a cold-water cutie who rocks the latest in shimmering scale fashion and can pull off the “blank yet captivating stare” better than any celebrity. I’m basically a living lava lamp with fins — calming and fabulous. If you’re looking for a low-maintenance sidekick who doubles as a tiny aquatic therapist , scoop me up!
