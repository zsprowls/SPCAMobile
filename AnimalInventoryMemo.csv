We only have their rabbit wood toys and all metal bowls and litter pans now for them on a concrete floor in the basement as they ate through the wooden rabbit hut i bought.  They do love to be outside but the heat makes that challenging but it seems to help relieve some evergy and create fun for them.""

I explained to surrenderer that I did not know if we had open kennels for them and that we schedule by appointment. Surrenderer stated his family told him they wanted them gone and asked where he could take them today to drop off because he doesn't want to just leave them outside somewhere. Rabbits were in a tote in the back of the surrenders vehicle and one did appear thin. Out of concern for the rabbits safety and checking if we had an open place for both rabbits, I booked both rabbits in. Surrenderer stated he had no money today after I told him what the surrender fees where and stated again that he had only paid $5.00 for them. I did send surrenderer with donation envelope. Surrenderer stated neither rabbits were given names and both have been housed together and he believes one is a female and the other is a male, no surr profile was filled out.

She is incredibly social and friendly, giving headbutts to every new friend she meets! Aster can be a bit more nervous in new situations, but having her best friend at her side always helps! We are both very playful and love to play with each other or with fun toys! We also can be found snuggling, cuddling, or having chats in front of a big, sunny window in our free time. If you’ve been waiting for two kitties with golden hearts and personalities that complement each other, that’s us! Come on by and let’s meet and remember one adoption fee for both of us !

Initiated & returned more slow blinks, ears forward. I picked her up to place her in a carrier, she did not hiss/swat nor retreat/retract/advance. Her muscles were relaxed and she did not attempt to escape upon being handled, placed calmly into carrier. She was calm while in the carrier, and walked calmly back into her kennel from the carrier once opened. She walked to the back of the kennel and sat upright with her tail wrapped around her body. She exhibited some lip licking, came forward once again to sniff hand when offered, ears forward & pupils appropriate for ambient lighting. Did hiss after pulling hand away.

If you have a cat at home, or are looking to adopt more than one, I might be the perfect fit for you! So, what are you waiting for?

Upon approaching her kennel, she got up, started vocalizing & flanking the kennel bars. Upon opening the kennel door, she rolled over with her head towards me, chin up, soliciting pets, purring, & kneading the air. She initiated & returned slow blinks when making eye contact. She continued to solicit pets with her chin facing up and head out of the kennel door in my lap, I was able to pet both sides of her face, forehead, chin, and down her back while she continued purring, soliciting pets, and kneading the air. Once she stood up, I picked her up and held her for several seconds. Her body remained relaxed, muscles loose, and she did not attempt to flee. After placing her back down, she once again solicited pets, and initiated and returned slow blinks. At no point did she hiss/swat or retreat/retract/advance. Her pupils remained appropriate for the ambient lighting throughout the encounter as well as ears up & forward. Based on my assessment, Mum would be an adoption candidate. - GE 10/13/25",Cat Isolation 234,10,Cat Isolation 234,4,1227,357

I enjoy hanging out, exploring new places, and taking in all the sights and smells. I’m also pretty curious, so adventures with me are never boring! I do like snacks and treats (who doesn’t?), and I’ll happily work for them, but food isn’t the only thing that makes me happy—I really just enjoy good company.

It took a few minutes of me sitting with him to get the leash over his head. He did initially try and bite the leash. once the leash was on he shook off and came right out of his kennel. He pulled slightly on leash and seemed slightly anxious outside. He did not use the bathroom outside but did go in the dog behavior office. He took a few minutes to warm up. Tolerated being touched but did not enjoy. He became very stiff and lip licked and whale eye. He did take hot dogs out of my hand and did engage in play with tennis balls and stuffy toys. Loosened up slightly when I tried to touch him during play, mouth was open and he was panting, tail was no longer tucked, did wag his tail when he saw tennis ball. Was unable to clip leash onto collar at this time as he was still very uncomfortable with touch. Was still very uncomfortable with slip leash going over his head (would shy away). tolerated me placing it on and taking it off. 9/24/25 ND Got Trouble out again today he was slightly more prosocial in his kennel.

When I approached the kennel door, he stood under the guillotine door and low growled. When I approached the back of the kennels, Trouble did approach the door but would run to the front when I opened it. I closed the guillotine door while he was in the back to see if I could go into the kennel with him to place the slip lead around his neck. When I opened the door, he pressed himself into the corner and began shaking. I crouched down and spoke to him softly, trying to coax him to me. He did approach once to sniff me and the leash, but ran quickly back to the corner when I moved. I tried to slowly approach him to leash him and that's when Trouble began to make hard eye contact and low growl at me. At this point I opted to leave the kennel as I was unsure of how far I would have been able to get with intake services. Will make B-Mod. 10/1/25 ND No issues harnessing trouble today. He did well on his walk. we stopped at one of the benches and just sat and watched. he did react to another dog but was able to be redirected.

RESPONSE 9/27 Hello yes king has been ok we’ve had issues with walks he sometimes gets overly excited and starts jumping at me and trying to play bite me I love him but he’s got sharp teeth is there any tips you can give me to get him to walk and not jump and bite and he’s got a little bit of a pulling problem I’m trying to work with him on but other then that he’s a sweet boy and I love him ???? MY RESPONSE: 9/29 Hi, Of course! I have attached some resources on walking and not jumping. I have also attached a few more that I think may be useful! If you have not tried a harness, I would recommend trying an ""easy-walk"" harness. These are designed to help with pulling, not an absolute fix but they can help! ADOPTERS RESPONSE: 9/30 Hello so I kind of ran into a problem with king I love him but I can’t keep him he’s too big and to wild for my complex I live in a complex with people with disabilities and my landlord said he can’t stay here so is there a place I can take him to be rehomed? I don’t want him to end up somewhere where he’d be neglected like I said if I could I would keep him but he’s not fit for my complex unfortunately  I WAS UNABLE TO RESPOND BEFORE ADOPTER SURRENDERED DOG",Dog Adoptions D,37,Dog Adoptions D,5,1227,357

ALD called and spoke with Ian who states that on 9/25/25, he attempted to take ""King"" on a harnessed walk. Ian states that King tried to pull and that King lunged at him on leash and bit him on the arms and leg (See attached photos). Ian states that he thinks King lunged at him because ""King"" realized that he was on leash. During the bite, Ian states that he called out for a neighbor to help him and that the neighbor ""threatened to turn him in"". ALD asked what this meant. Ian states that he is not allowed to have pets in his apartment and that his neighbor threated to inform that landlord, as ""King"" had been barking alot. ALD questioned why it took them so many days to come here to return ""King"". Ian states that he gave ""King"" to another person living in his apartment complex and that she took him from 9/25/25 to 10/1/25. Ian states that the person he gave the dog too couldn't keep ""King"" because he ""barks too much"". ALD and TMC got a verbal sign over from Ian. As ALD was completing contract, Elizabeth, Ians partner, states that King ""tried to bite her four times"" the night prior. When ALD questioned what triggered this behavior, Elizabeth states that she was trying to get him to follow commands (sit) and that he ""wouldn't listen"". Elizabeth states that ""King"" does not like long walks and that he jumps alot, leaving bruises on her upper thighs. At the end of the conversation, Elizabeth states that ""King"" gave Ian a panic attack the night before and that she ""had to hide the knives in the home from him"". Elizabeth states that Crisis Services advised Ian that he should return ""King"" to our care // ALD",Dog Adoptions D,37,Dog Adoptions D,5,1227,357

In this latest event yesterday, King bit a volunteer on the arm, resulting in a level two bite. We also revisited the previous bite report from King’s former owner, which involved a level three bite, also occurring during a walk. While we have not been able to determine a specific trigger for these behaviors, the pattern of incidents during walks, combined with the severity of the previous bites, raises significant safety concerns. After careful consideration, we have made the difficult decision that King Condrell is no longer a safe candidate for adoption. For this reason we are electing humane euthanasia for behavioral reasons. This can be done at the techs earliest convenience. LJA",Dog Adoptions D,37,Dog Adoptions D,5,1227,357

The most recent occurred on August 7, 2023, when Shadow bit a neighbor who subsequently sought medical attention. The extent of the injury was not fully known, as the neighbor’s ankle was bandaged when the owner arrived to the scene. The owner also reported a prior bite involving the same person, which similarly required medical care. During the veterinary evaluation, Shadow was prescribed Trazodone to help manage anxiety and stress, and it was recommended that a muzzle be used for all future visits to ensure safety. Given the documented history of repeated aggression resulting in injury, and the associated safety concerns, we have determined that Shadow is not a suitable candidate for adoption. Therefore, we are proceeding with humane euthanasia due to behavioral reasons. This will be carried out as soon as the veterinary team is available. //LJA",Dog Holding E,25,Dog Holding E,7,1227,357

UPON APPROACH SHE WAS ALARM BARKING BUT HER TAIL WAS NEUTRAL, WAGGING SLOW AND WIDE. HER EARS WERE BACK. I SAT BY HER DOOR AND GAVE HER TREATS. SHE CAME AND APPROACHED ME SHE SNIFFED UNDER THE DOOR. SHE DID EAT THE TREATS INFRONT OF ME. IF I MOVED TO QUCIKLY SHE WOULD START ALARM BARKING AGAIN. AFTER A FEW MINUTES SHE STOPPED ALARM BARKING AS I WAS MOVING TO GET MORE TREATS. WHEN I STOOD UP TO WALK AWAY SHE STARTED ALARM BARKING AGAIN. I ASKED HER TO SIT IN WHICH SHE DID AND I REWARDED AND WALKED AWAY. 10/11/25 MW Went to kennel to grab Onyx for intake services. Upon approach, she gave me very wiggly body language and jumped right up onto the kennel door. When I opened the door, she alarm barked multiple times but did not move. After sniffing my arm, she allowed me to leash her very easily. Onyx walked well into the infirmary but did have very nervous, jumpy energy. She was ok with her head and shoulders being pet, but if I stroked down to her flank, she would turn very quickly towards my hand and get stiff. During intake, she rolled over onto her back and exposed her stomach. Paige went to check for a spay scar as previous owners stated that Onyx was spayed. When Paige made contact with her abdomen, Onyx very abruptly jumped up and gave a correction/warning bite (light pressure, no marks left). At this point, we opted to muzzle Onyx for the rest of her intake services. She attempted to remove the muzzle several times, but we were able to perform all intake services. Even with the muzzle on, Onyx seemed very reactive whenever Paige had to touch her flank. Once intake services were finished, Paige and I tried once again to verify a spay scar but Onyx was too stressed out. She did allow me to walk her back to the kennel, remove the leash, and apply Revolution without any issue. 10/11/25 ND Spoke with MW about incident noted above. Went to visit Onyx later in the afternoon. She initially was alarm barking but as I started speaking to her she became wiggly. I tossed her treats and would reward her for looking at me and not barking. Kept session short as she had a stressful da 10/15/25 ND Spent some time with Onyx outside of her kennel. She did well without alarm barking and approached in a cautious but prosocial way. Did get spooked and ran to the back of her kennel. Seemed very timid after will attempt to remove from kennel on 10/16",Dog Holding F,29,Dog Holding F,8,1227,357

She hasn’t laid any eggs yet, but she’s full of potential and even more full of love. Ruby is friendly, curious, and sometimes a bit chatty—especially when she’s feeling brave! By her side is her loyal protector and best friend, Papi, a stunning and kind-hearted rooster who looks out for Soph with all the grace and charm a rooster can muster. Papi is not only beautiful to look at, but also incredibly sweet and easy to be around. These two share a strong bond, and our wish is for them to be adopted together, so Sophia can continue to feel safe and loved with Papi watching over her. If you’re looking to add a little love, fluff, and friendship to your life, Ruby and Papi would make the perfect addition to a caring flock or family. ??

A car pulls up with Dejuan and Shanenequkia. Dejuan is automatically hostile saying that they tried to take the dog to several emergency clinics but that none of them had doctors available. He then said that he took the dog to OPVMC and they offered to treat the dog but he needed to pay $200 to get diagnostics to which he declined because he did not have the money and took the dog home. As I was trying to speak with him he became volatile and told me to just 'take the fucking bitch' and to leave him alone because he tried and that there are other animals that need more help than her. He repeatedly kept tell me to just 'take the bitch' and went inside was still yelling grabbed the dog and pushed her towards me. I secured the dog with a leash and Shanenequkia asked if there would be a way that they could get her back, I told her she would need to call dispatch. Dejuan stormed off to the vehicle and Shanenequkia went into the vehicle as well which was parked right behind our car. As I was putting the dog in the trunk Dejuan driving the vehicle sped towards myself, the intern and the dog almost hitting us scaring the dog badly, then sped off quickly.

She has two kittens fostering for socialization. I called and she said Bingo hisses when she tries to pet her and ""freaked out"" when she was holding her to introduce her to a friend. I explained the importance of positive reinforcement, going at the animal's pace, and not forcing them into scary or uncomfortable situations. It seems like she and Bingo have a good relationship, but she's worried about her doing well with new people. I told her to, for now, start at square one for new people, don't force interactions, and use positive reinforcement to build positive associations with new people. - GE 9/24/25",Foster Home,299,Foster Home,139,1227,357

Owner was suppossed to come in 9/26 and no showed and then no showed 9/29/2025. Owner came in this morning and when I told owner it was going to be $900.00 she said she spoke with BW and BW told her she could pay $50.00 deposit and then when the court settlement came through from the person that hit the dog she would sign the check over to SPCA to pay the $850.00 balance??? I ran this by BW who said she never told her that. After back and forth SPCA will put Chapo into SPCA foster care as the dog will need several bandage changes and the owner does not qualify for Care Credit. I explained to the owner that we will put the dog in foster which means he will remain the SPCA's property until medically cleared and then BEFORE we return the dog legally to her we will process the $900.00 plus $25.00 fee through Vet Billing IF she has not received money from the settlement....BW is good with this arrangement. I also discussed this with Chief Wood as I wanted an Officer to reiterate that the dog is SPCA property until medically cleared and that the owner MUST show up for all medical follow up appointments! Per RR per Dr. Kean bandage will be changed this afternoon and owner can come in at 3:00pm to pick up dog. I did update all the owner information and will notify Foster Care that she will be here at 3:00pm. SMV",Foster Home,299,Foster Home,139,1227,357

She did not have much interest in toys but she was a lot more engaged during the walk. 11/14/2023 Sr 11:00AM Noble did well on her walk. She appears to be positively interested in other dogs and I believe I will coordinate a meet and greet with fellow staff members. As this will make her more marketable for adopters. 11/15/2023 SR 12:48PM Noble was good on her walk and walked well. Nothing notable. 11/17/23 ND I took Noble for a walk this morning. offered treats in the kennel which she did take before I leash her. No issues putting the leash on. She was really great outside, she is very fun and bouncy. She was very interested in exploring the environment. No issues fitting her for a collar or bringing her back to the kennel. Really great gal!! 11/20/2023 SR I had Noble out for a walk and some enrichment. She walked well on leash and was very excitable jumping up on my every so-often to solicit attention. When brought back to the behavior office she was mildly mischievous but overall well-behaved. Obsessed with food as expected. 11/21/2023 SR ~ 30 minutes Upon approach at her kennel she was giving me soft eyes, demand barks and some wide wags. She readily went up to the kennel and jumped up when she saw me. She was very high-energy when I entered her kennel but allowed me to leash without issue. She used the restroom outside and pulled intermittently but otherwise good walker. I gave a bath and washed her twice but she still is pretty odorous. Behaved ok but still not a fan of the bath. 11/22/2023 SR ~ 15 minutes I took Noble out for a walk after sometime surgery. Nothing notable as she was a shell of her former self after surgery. Used the restroom outside without issue. 11/27/2023 SR ~ 25 MINUTES I took Noble out for some enrichment and a walk. She walked well and was well-behaved for most of the walk. Very playful when brought into the enrichment room and let go of toys when asked. Before the walk, she had a meet and greet with Miley (A0054811914). When approached at the fence she displayed some stiff body but offered appropriate sniffs. When Miley entered the same yard she was very vocal and whining while pulling to get to her. When they were able to meet face to face she was interested and mostly appropriate but very high-energy. She appeared to be too much for Miley and Miley offered some low-growls when Noble placed her head on top of hers before jumping towards her. 11/28/2023 SR ~ 30 minutes Brought Noble back in from kennel and brought her to Education center (left side) for some playtime. She was very well-behaved and we worked more with impulse control. She appears to be already well-trained but still very forward when it comes to meeting new people or going through doors. Easy fix by working on wait and until she is give a command like ""go ahead"" or similar when the appropriate behavior is displayed. We played fetch approximately 8 times engaged in a chase game a couple times before ending session. 11/29-30/2023 SR ~ 45 -1 hour each I took Noble for a walk and fitted her for a new harness and leash. Walked well with new harness and stayed at an appropriate distance from me when walking. She was very agile and treat-motivated during her play session. Responded appropriately the chase game and responding to commands. Better with waiting for toys but still needs more work. She is really good with jumping as high as she can for her toys. In addition, I brought her in to meet my ARK group and she was very appropriate and borderline gentle when it comes to taking toys and. She was more on the rough side when it comes to taking treats. 12/02/2023 SR I had Noble out for a walk and some enrichment time in the room. She was great as usual. No issues. 12/11/2023 SR I had Noble out for a walk and some playtime in the ed center. Great and very responsive to commands. 12/12-13/2023 SR 3:30PM She did well in her play session as usual. Appears to enjoy jumping high for her toy. Very responsive to recall and directions when prompted.",If The Fur Fits,259,If The Fur Fits,37,1227,357

I love to play and be silly, and I’ve got a goofy side that will keep you smiling every day. I’m also a smart girl—I already know sit, stay, paw, and down, and I’d be happy to keep learning more with you. Walks are one of my favorite activities, and I enjoy exploring the world with my person by my side. One thing to know about me—I need to be the only dog in the house.

Being with each other gives us comfort and confidence, so we’re looking for a home that can welcome both of us . We’re super smart — we already know sit, stay, and down, and we’re always up for learning more (especially if treats are involved). We love going for walks, splashing in the water, meeting new people, and soaking up all the love and attention we can get. We’re affectionate, social, and very in tune with our people. Because of our size and strength, we’re hoping to find a home with experience with large dogs — someone who understands the joys and responsibilities of having two big cuddle bugs around. If you’ve got room in your heart (and on your couch!) for two loyal, loving companions, we promise we’ll fill your life with double the love, double the loyalty, and double the tail wags.",If The Fur Fits,259,If The Fur Fits,37,1227,357

I explained that it was necessary to get the kitten in ASAP for the suture removal. She stated that she has to work most days and that coming in was basically impossible. She offered me a tentative date which was 2-3 weeks from now. I explained that we can not wait that long to do the recheck and remove the sutures and that she needed to come in this week for the exam. I offered her any day and any time with multiple options for the recheck which she all declined. She gets out of work on Thursday at 3:00 pm so I offered her a 4:00 pm slot with foster care hoping that the vet staff would be able to examine the kitten (vet appointments are not normally done on Thursdays).

At this age, I’ve got the whole “calm and cool” thing down. I’m the kind of dog who likes to find a cozy spot, lay down, and quietly take in everything happening around me. I’m a great listener, an even better companion, and I’ll always be nearby, just enjoying your company. I’m sweet and social — I like meeting new people and other friendly pets too. I’m not the wild toy-chasing type, but I do have a soft spot for a good squeaky toy every now and then.

The SPCA assumed that the owner got someone to take the cat. No one was in communication with each other. On Monday 9/8 the owner of the property arrived with Joe Miranda to find the cat in the locked apartment sitting in the window. Upon entering the apartment the cat appeared extremely skinny and thirsty. Taco meat and a bowl of water were offered to the cat who devoured both immediately. the SPCA was contacted and Joe offered to bring the cat to the shelter. Agents were dispatched to the location but then would not take the cat from Joe since he had no eviction paperwork. Joe was then directed to get the cat and bring it to the SPCA. Upon arrival at the shelter the cat was booked in under the person who left it behind and not Joe Miranda. I spoke to TMC and she was going to change it but that hasn't been done yet.

I love people — especially when I can lean in close or sit on your feet just to be near you. I really enjoy spending time outside, feeling the breeze and exploring the world around me. I think I’d do best in a calm, peaceful home where I can relax and feel safe. Having another friendly dog around would be wonderful too — they help me feel more confident and playful.

They proceeded to walk toward the adoption entrance and placed what appeared to be a box or animal carrier (the exact item is unclear from the footage) in front of the doors. The individual then returned to the vehicle and departed. Investigations conducted a search on the vehicle’s registration, which identified the owner as Miracle Faith McNair (PID 41603313).

Attempts were made to contact Ms. McNair using the two phone numbers listed in her account. One number was unable to receive calls, and the other did not connect to voicemail. The animals involved in this incident are two guinea pigs, identified by PetPoint IDs 59541142 and 59541144.
